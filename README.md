## Sub-branch: Bag of tricks

Here, we intetegrate some of useful tricks to enhance the performance of existing adversarial attacks. Feel free to search the optima hyper-parameter to find the real-performance of different attacks. 

***Notice*** The use of tricks to boost the performance depends on different models, datasets, and even library versions. While we use different images in our paper with this open-source library,  we will continue our effort to update the known optima hyper-parameters for different attacks under the setting of this library, thus to benchmarking the attack performance of different methods for future research:)
