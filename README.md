<h1 align="center">TransferAttack: Bag of Tricks</h1>


Here, we intetegrate some of useful tricks to enhance the performance of existing adversarial attacks. Feel free to search the optima hyper-parameter to find the real-performance of different attacks. New methods may not be involved here. Please check [the official TA library](https://github.com/Trustworthy-AI-Group/TransferAttack) for recent updates on the design of transferable adversarial attacks. 

***Notice:*** The use of tricks to boost the performance depends on different models, datasets, and even library versions. While we use different images in our paper with this open-source library,  we will continue our efforts to update the known optima hyper-parameters for different attacks under the setting of this library, thus to benchmarking the attack performance of different methods for future research:)
